# TinyApp

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). The app allows users to sign in with a user name, email, and password. Bcrypt is used to hash passwords, and cookie-session is used to create login sessions. Logged in users can add, edit, and delete URLs, and non-logged in visitors can view all URLs on the site but cannot alter them.
